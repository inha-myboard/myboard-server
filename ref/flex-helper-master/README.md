# Flex helper
CSS3 flexbox helper classes.

The helper CSS classes mimic box layout systems of popular UI toolkits (like QT, GTK, .NET, Android, Kivy, ExtJS...).

### Usage

Add **flex-helper.css** to your code and start using the CSS classes documented ([See them in action with examples.html](http://munawwar.github.io/flex-helper/examples.html)).

### Browser Support

flex-helper.css supports IE 11, MS Edge 13+, Safari 9 and latest Chrome and Firefox.

For older browsers support, use:

legacy/flex-helper-2012.css for supporting IE 10+ and Safari 7+ as well.

or legacy/flex-helper-2009.css for supporting IE 10+, UC Browser and Safari 6+ as well.

### Documentation

```
vbox          - Stack child items vertically (the "main axis" for child items is now
                the vertical axis)
hbox          - Stack child items horizontally (the "main axis" for child items is now
                the horizontal axis)
flex          - Stretch item along parent's main-axis

main-start    - Stack child items to the main-axis start
main-center   - Stack child items to the main-axis center
main-end      - Stack child items to the main-axis end

cross-start,
cross-center,
cross-end     - Similar to the 'main' counterparts, except that
                these decide the stacking of child items along the cross-axis.
cross-stretch - Stretch child items along the cross-axis

stretch-self  - Stretch item along parent's cross-axis. Overrides any cross-* class behavior on parent.
center-self   - Centers item along parent's cross-axis. Overrides any cross-* class behavior on parent.

wrap          - Wrap child items to next line on main-axis. hbox wraps by default so no need to add this
                classes for hbox.
nowrap        - Prevent wrapping of items to next line on main-axis.
```

### Documentation with examples
[See them in action with examples.html](http://munawwar.github.io/flex-helper/examples.html).

For older browser support:

See flexbox-2012.css examples [here](http://munawwar.github.io/flex-helper/legacy/examples-2012.html).

See flexbox-2009.css examples [here](http://munawwar.github.io/flex-helper/legacy/examples-2009.html).

### RTL support

Setting CSS `direction: rtl;` on body tag should cause all rows to be reversed in order. This is part of the flexbox specification. Nothing special needs to be done. If you have any case where row shouldn't be reversed, then set dir="ltr" on the hbox div.

### BUGS!

One notable bug in IE 10-11, is that using min-height/min-width along with flex box doesn't work as expected.

There are other bugs documented at [flexbox-bugs](https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs).
Note: However flex-helper doesn't use all of the flexbox syntax. So some of them are not relevant.
